## Directional Gaussian smoothing method
This repository contains Python code for testing Directional Gaussian smoothing (DGS) method on high-dimensional benchmark functions. This method was first introduced in the paper [*A Novel Evolution Strategy with Directional Gaussian Smoothing for Blackbox Optimization*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03001.pdf) by Jiaxin Zhang, Hoang Tran, Dan Lu and Guannan Zhang.

The forms of things *unknown*, the poetâ€TMs pen,
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing,
A local *habitation* and a **name**.
